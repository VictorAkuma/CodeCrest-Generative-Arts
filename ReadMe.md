## How It Works  
The process of creating CodeCrest designs involves a blend of programming using processing.js/P5.js (a JavaScript library), artistic vision, and printing technology.  

### 1. Conceptualizing the Design  
- Start by brainstorming a design idea using mathematical concepts.  
- Translate the idea into a programmable format that can be rendered visually using programming languages such as P5.js, JavaScript, or Processing.

### 2. Writing the Code  
- Write lines of code to create generative or algorithmic art. For instance, use JavaScript frameworks like p5.js.  
- Experiment with shapes, colours, patterns, and randomness to develop unique visuals.  

### 3. Rendering the Artwork  
- Run the code to generate the final artwork.  
- Export the output in a high-resolution format (e.g., PNG, SVG).  

### 4. Prepping for Printing  
- Use graphic design tools (e.g., Adobe Illustrator or Photoshop) to fine-tune the artwork if necessary.  
- Convert the file to a print-friendly format, ensuring the design aligns with the shirtâ€™s dimensions.  

### 5. Cresting the Design on Shirts  
- We target to use a professional printing technique, such as:  
  - Screen Printing: Ideal for bulk orders with bold colours.  
  - Direct-to-Garment (DTG): Great for detailed designs and smaller batches.  
  - Heat Transfer: Suitable for high-quality prints with vibrant colours.  
- Test the print to ensure quality and consistency.  

### 6. Packaging and Delivery 
- We will package the finished product in eco-friendly materials.  
- Deliver to customers promptly, ensuring the experience is seamless and professional.
